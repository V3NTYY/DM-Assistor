### DM Assistor (on indefinite hiatus)
A tool used to help DM's manage their game more efficiently.

## Want to run this app?
I'm currently compiling an executable which will be uploaded here at a later date -- check back later!

# Features
- A beautiful initiative tracker with several options for individual or party initiative.
- Player stat tracker -- keep track of player AC, passive perception.
- Utilizes an API (_To be determined_) to retrieve and populate a monster stat block -- can be used for initiative, monster reference, etc...
- Utilizes an AI to help generate prompts and hooks for more interactive story-telling, or if you've only had one hour to prepare the session.
- Integrated support with DNDBeyond -- allow extra sources to be pulled and sync character sheets in real time.
- More features to be added.
