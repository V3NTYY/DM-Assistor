Download WxWidgets, create a folder besides this text file exactly named "wxwidgets"
Extract the contents of the downloaded zip to the "wxwidgets folder"
Navigate to build/msw, and launch wx_vc17.sln

You will use this to build the libs for wxWidget for the project, wx_vc17 corresponds to your version of visual studio (latest preferably)

Once you launch, navigate select debug, and Windows32 for the system.
Click on the ribbon on the top, select Build -> Build Solution

Repeat this for the following:

debug -> Win32
release -> Win32
debug -> x64
release -> x64

This will build all of the libraries for wxWidget. Once you have completed this, the project will already have the settings applied and you will be good to go.
